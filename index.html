        <h2>🌸 The Day I Realized You're the One</h2>
        <p>
            It was the day we decided to end something truly beautiful between us. We both knew we had to stop seeing each other, even though it hurt. I tried to block you everywhere, hoping it would make things easier, but my mind wouldn’t let go of you. The anxiety kept building, and my heart felt restless. That was the moment I realized we were more than just friends—and that letting you go was far harder than I ever imagined.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-item">
        <h2>💌 Our First Date</h2>
        <p>
            We had so many first dates, but the one that lives deepest in me is the day we went to Ama Café at the Mall of Doon. That day feels like a golden memory I keep tucked away just for myself. The way you smiled at me, the way our conversations flowed for hours without effort, and how safe and comfortable I felt sitting next to you—it was in that quiet, unspoken moment that I knew I wanted you.
            <br></br>
            There were other moments too, like the days we spent at D11 Café, when time seemed to slow down and it felt like the world existed only in that small space between us. And then there was our original first date at Wild Wisteria Café. Even as you spoke about your exes and I felt a gentle ache of jealousy, my heart was still full. I was just so happy to be there with you. That was the day I realized I was falling for you—softly, deeply, without resistance. And I am so grateful that I did.
        </p>

    <div class="story-item">
        <h2>😂 All Our Little Moments</h2>
        <p>
            From our inside jokes to our silly love for food, every moment with you is wrapped in laughter. Whether we’re watching a show together or just being goofy in each other’s presence, you always know how to make me smile without even trying. It’s these quiet, little moments—the ones that don’t ask for attention—that slowly weave themselves into the most beautiful tapestry of our love.
        </p>

    <div class="story-item">
        <h2>❤️ Choosing You</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly, I could write an entire book about why I choose you every single day. Your kindness, your laughter, your constant support—each of them makes me fall in love with you more and more. And I love every fucking thing about you. The way you laugh, the way you act like a child sometimes, the way you understand me without needing words, and the way you make me feel so incredibly special.

Every day, through everything, I still choose you. Loving you has been the easiest decision of my life and my favorite journey. I love you, Paru.
